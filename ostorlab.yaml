  This repository is an implementation of [Ostorlab Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) for the [zap Fingerprinter](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/zap.git).

  ## Getting Started
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command.
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/zap domain-name tesla.com
  ```

  This command will download and install `agent/ostorlab/zap`.
  For more information, please refer to the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)


  ## Usage

  Agent zap can be installed directly from the ostorlab agent store or built from this repository.

   ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store

   ```shell
   ostorlab agent install agent/ostorlab/zap
   ```

  You can then run the agent with the following command:

  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --agent agent/ostorlab/zap domain-name tesla.com
  ```


  ### Build directly from the repository

   1. To build the zap agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.

  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```

   2. Clone this repository.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_zap.git && cd agent_zap
  ```

   3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.

   ```shell
   ostorlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml --force
   ```
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.

   1. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
  	 * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
  	  ```shell
  	  ostorlab scan run --agent agent//zap domain-name tesla.com
  	  ```
  	 * If you specified an organization when building the image:
  	  ```shell
  	  ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/zap domain-name tesla.com
  	  ```
